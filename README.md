# Data-Analysis-for-Cardboard-Development

This repository consists of two files: 
- One file is a python file containing the program that will analyze the data.
- The other is a CSV file containing the sample data that will be processed.

The repository:
- It contains the sample data.
- It needs to be downloaded.
- Please copy the Path of the downloaded CSV file.

The program:
- In the "File Input", please input the Path of the downloaded CSV file.
- The Path that is already in the code is the Path locally stored in my computer;
  and it will not work if you did not replace the Path as specified.
- Or if the device is connected to the internet, you may use the raw github data samples.

Updates:
- The program now currently runs not more than 1.9 seconds in my computer.
- In the past it has been known to run more than 60 seconds but not more than 80 seconds.
- As of January 29: New statistical tests have been included.
- As of January 30: New sample data have been included.
- As of Febuary 2: Edited Student T-Test to fix for incorrect p-value and edited sample data. 
  Cannot be anymore runned in the Google Colaboratory due to argument error by the cloud service.
- As of February 8: Changes in two-tailed p-value.
- As of August 1: Added visual histogram results for both groups.

Note: I am open for any changes and suggestions. Questions regarding the program are very welcome.
