# Data-Analysis-for-Cardboards

This repository consists of two files: 
- One file is a python file containing the program that will analyze the data.
- The other is a CSV file containing the sample data that will be processed.

The file:
- It contains the sample data.
- It needs to be downloaded.
- Please copy the Path of the downloaded CSV file.

The program:
- In the "File Input", please input the Path of the downloaded CSV file.
- The Path that is already in the code is the Path locally stored in my computer;
  and it will not work if you did not replace the Path as specified.
- It is not yet completely done since it is missing the "Test for Normality";
  and the Mann-Whitney U test. (The assumption is that all data are currently normal.)

Updates:
- The program now currently runs not more than 1.9 seconds in my computer.
- In the past it has been known to run more than 60 seconds but not more than 80 seconds.

Note: I am open for any changes and suggestions. Questions regarding the program are very welcome.
